                <h2 id="introduction">Motion design isn’t just eye candy; it’s UX infrastructure</h2>
                <p>
                    Remember the days where we had blinking banners and fully static (sometimes, all too colorful)
                    webpages?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yeah, we’ve come pretty far with the World Wide Web—hello, AI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, brands are rethinking user experience with one powerful tool: motion design. Motion design
                    serves both function and feel, which are crucial parts of a user’s digital experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what constitutes a great digital experience? We believe that would be one that flows
                    effortlessly, is emotionally resonant, and is story-driven; something that motion design can help
                    you achieve. Plus, you only have about 50 milliseconds to make an impression on the web and
                    animations can convey a message quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On top of that, users now expect fluidity, feedback, and fast-loading digital interfaces. Artificial
                    intelligence (AI) can be part of that picture, but it doesn’t mean it has to dominate the entire
                    process. Now, let’s dive into how motion design can strengthen your entire user experience (UX).
                </p>

                <h2 id="aesthetics">Motion design serves more than just aesthetics</h2>
                <p>
                    Everybody creates content but motion design helps cut through the clutter and noise to get your
                    message heard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Want your audience to look at your key features? Use scroll-triggered animations that reveal them
                    one by one. How about creating a brand style for that vibe check? Try slow fluid fades or soft
                    easing curves for a calming, trustworthy feel (perfect for a wellness brand!). Or use snappy and
                    clean transitions if you’d like to suggest efficiency and control for a fintech brand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This isn’t new information though. A study from 1996 evaluated how transition smoothness, realism,
                    and interactivity influence decision accuracy, speed, and user satisfaction. It confirmed that
                    gradual and interactive animations support clearer mental models and improve overall performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are also more recent studies that support this. A 2024 study found that techniques like
                    staging and tracing animations in time-series visualizations help users identify patterns more
                    accurately and quickly, effectively reducing cognitive load.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plus, animations convey messages much faster than static images would. In fact, Korean food delivery
                    app, Baemin, turned their static icons into animated ones to give users more clarity. For example,
                    their “Order Together” service icon was initially interpreted as a friend-adding icon, but after
                    animating it, it explained the meaning of togetherness and helped users understand its actual
                    function.
                </p>

                <h2 id="scaling">How teams are scaling motion today</h2>
                <p>
                    Historically, when thinking of adding animations, we often worried it would compromise our website,
                    especially the load time. Besides that, adding motion also presented bottlenecks like must-have
                    After Effects skills, endless rounds of QA, and developer negotiations.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="text-lg">
                    But things are different now.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    There are more tools that push motion without having to design from scratch. Even LottieFiles for
                    Webflow allows you to simply drag-and-drop from a library of over 100,000 free and ready-to-use
                    lightweight, scalable Lottie animations into your Webflow site—without needing to code. And if
                    you’re an existing LottieFiles user, you can access your team’s private animations and insert them
                    into your Webflow site too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, LottieFiles for Webflow lets you personalize animations with the app’s color palette. The
                    best part? It also supports trigger-based animations like page load, parallax, and reveal to give
                    you a more connected UX.
                </p>

                <h2 id="examples">Real examples of motion in brand UX</h2>
                <p>
                    With elements that enter or respond on a page, it can help signal tone, brand personality, and
                    intention. For example, a simple bouncing animation could create a playful tone, while using scale
                    and timing can grab attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But not all motion is created equal. There are different file formats such as Lottie animation, a
                    JSON-based file format, that is more lightweight compared to other formats like GIF or MP4s. Lottie
                    works better for digital experiences as it’s also infinitely scalable without pixelation and has
                    multi-platform support and libraries, as well as interactivity (great for interactions like
                    scrolling, clicking, and hovering). Plus, because it’s small, it doesn’t compromise page load speed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides Lottie animation, there is an even smaller file format — dotLottie. dotLottie is a more
                    optimized Lottie format that bundles one or more Lottie animations in one, which helps improve load
                    times and memory usage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But don’t take just our word for it, here are some other real-life examples of motion in UX:
                </p>

                <h3 id="cnn">CNN Create turns storytelling into a moving experience</h3>
                <p>
                    CNN Create’s Booming Bangladesh story used simple Lottie animations to complement the narrative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CNN Create saw the value of animations with their ‘Booming Bangladesh’ story as they used animations
                    with a long vertical scroll. Their smooth and subtle Lottie animations guided users through the
                    narrative without causing distractions or breaks in engagement—perfect for an engaging, informative
                    digital experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result? The average time spent was two and half minutes across 30,000 unique visitors.
                </p>

                <h3 id="gojek">Gojek optimizes performance & app speed with dotLottie</h3>
                <p>
                    Gojek, a Southeast Asian multi-service tech platform, uses animations to convey various service
                    elements in their user interface (UI). The team implemented dotLottie which allowed them to include
                    more animations without exceeding app limits. In fact, their “Safe Trip Plus” animation shrank from
                    844 KB to just 107 KB.
                </p>

                <h3 id="wise">Wise improves customer comprehension with user-friendly animations</h3>

                    Wise, a global Fintech company, implemented dotLottie animations in their simplified UI, product
                    demos, photography, and storytelling— solidifying Wise’s reputation in providing a user-friendly,
                    dynamic and innovative user experience. Adding these animations ultimately increased user
                    comprehension of Wise’s key features.

                <h3 id="spoon">Spoon brings emotional resonance with visually-rich animations</h3>
                <p>
                    Global tech startup, Spoon, redefines social connection through an audio-based content platform.
                    They understood that emotions like gratitude, encouragement, and joy are hard to capture with static
                    visuals, so they turned to animations. But they also needed it to be lightweight and non-disruptive,
                    which led them to Lottie that keeps their files under 1MB.

                <h2 id="ai">Can AI help with adding motion to your website?</h2>
                <p>
                    In short: yes, it can help with motion…but in a more supportive role. AI can help with layout ideas,
                    auto-tag content, or even recommend design patterns based on your data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The thing is, AI can’t feel the way we do. At least not yet. That’s where designing a screen
                    transition, understanding how elements react to a tap, or how an empty state makes you feel still
                    requires empathy, brand context, and UX thinking— this is where your focus should be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AI helps move the creative process along much faster, so you can focus on implementing motion that
                    actually evokes emotion and connects to your audience.
                </p>

                <h2 id="deliver-results">Motion does more than delight — it delivers results</h2>
                <p>
                    By now, we’ve established that motion is no longer for just delight. It helps build trust, set the
                    site direction, and enhance brand feel—key factors that help drive results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Motion is a language you speak to reach your users. While AI and no-code tools handle the heavy
                    lifting, motion can be your differentiator in any industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember, instead of focusing on your projects looking good, make sure they feel good too. Make it
                    intuitive— make it move.
                </p>
